In the mission phase, intial prototype will not be very interactive, mostly just watch execution of your plan.

Bonuses will add in-mission decisions to be made. (rerouting, consumable use, etc)

As such, this mode is straightforward for the player, display wise they need information to see what happens.

A log on one side will inform the player of successes/failures, above it is the current execution time vs target time vs time limit. Security level can be found here as well.

Because the player can't do tons here (potentially) it is important to keep the run-time short so it's not disruptive to the gameplay flow. Probably do a few tests to see how it feels.
