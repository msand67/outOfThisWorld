When planning, there will be a list of 'must complete' rooms. They will have stars on their rooms. If there is a required order, the will have a number next to the star.

When a plan is made, an estimated time to complete will be listed. Each mission has a soft time limit, going over that will start to increase security. Checks get harder, and failures add more time. Go over by too much, and the plan fails.
